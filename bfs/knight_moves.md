# Knight Moves

A friend of you is doing research on the Traveling Knight Problem (TKP) where you are to find the
shortest closed tour of knight moves that visits each square of a given set of n squares on a chessboard
exactly once. He thinks that the most difficult part of the problem is determining the smallest number
of knight moves between two given squares and that, once you have accomplished this, finding the tour
would be easy.
Of course you know that it is vice versa. So you offer him to write a program that solves the
”difficult” part.
Your job is to write a program that takes two squares a and b as input and then determines the
number of knight moves on a shortest route from a to b.
